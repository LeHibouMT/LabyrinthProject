# Projet Labyrinthe

<p align="justify">Taing Michel E3S C++.
It's a project for ESIEE Paris during my third year at university.. It was made with some files from school and my work is mostly in Eleves.ccp.
The code should be opened with Visual Studio.
It is a game that introduces a labyrinth where the player will face traps and mummies.</p>
